## Features

### Core Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and sign-up functionality using `shared_preferences` for persistent storage. Users can register with a username, email, and password, and log in to access personalized features.
- **Appointment Booking**: Users can schedule appointments by selecting a department, doctor, appointment type, and providing a reason for the visit. A confirmation receipt is generated with details like appointment ID, date, and time.
- **Feedback System**: Authenticated users can submit feedback with a satisfaction rating (1-5 stars) and comments, which are stored locally and displayed in the dashboard.
- **Dashboard**: A personalized dashboard displaying user profile information, appointment history, feedback history, and data visualizations (charts for appointments by department, patient satisfaction, and appointment status).
- **Responsive Design**: The app adapts to different screen sizes (mobile and tablet) using `LayoutBuilder` for a consistent user experience.
- **Text Size Customization**: Users can adjust text size for better accessibility using a floating action button with increase, decrease, and reset options.
- **Navigation**: A tab-based navigation system with Home, Appointments, Feedback, and Dashboard sections, accessible via a responsive app bar or drawer (on mobile).

### Additional Features
- **Hero Section**: A visually appealing landing page with a background image, gradient overlay, and key statistics (e.g., number of doctors, departments, and patients).
- **Mission & Vision**: Displays the medical center's mission and vision statements in a dedicated section.
- **Services Section**: Highlights available medical services.
- **Contact Section**: Provides contact details (address, phone, email) with clickable links to initiate calls or emails using the `url_launcher` package.
- **PDF Generation**: Supports generating appointment receipts as PDF documents using the `pdf` and `printing` packages (though not fully implemented in the provided code).

## Development Notes

### Design Choices
- **Responsive Design**: The app uses `LayoutBuilder` to adjust layouts based on screen size, ensuring a consistent experience on mobile and tablet devices.
- **Theming**: A custom `ThemeData` with indigo as the primary color and Poppins as the font family provides a professional and cohesive look.
- **State Management**: The `provider` package is used for efficient state management, with separate providers for authentication (`AuthService`), appointments (`AppointmentService`), feedback (`FeedbackService`), and text scaling (`TextSizeProvider`).
- **Accessibility**: Text size adjustment enhances usability for users with visual impairments.
- **Animations**: Subtle animations (e.g., `AnimatedOpacity`, `AnimatedSlide`) improve the user experience without overwhelming the interface.

### Known Limitations
- **Local Storage**: User data, appointments, and feedback are stored locally using `shared_preferences`, which is not suitable for production-scale apps. Consider integrating a backend (e.g., Firebase) for persistent storage.
- **Firebase Integration**: The `firebase_core` package is included but not used. Full Firebase integration is needed for features like cloud-based authentication or data storage.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is implemented, but more robust validation and error messages could improve user experience.

### Future Improvements
- **Backend Integration**: Replace `shared_preferences` with a backend solution (e.g., Firebase Firestore) for scalable data storage.
- **Enhanced Authentication**: Implement password recovery, email verification, and OAuth providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).
- **Push Notifications**: Add notifications for appointment reminders or feedback confirmation.
- **Advanced Charts**: Expand data visualizations with more interactive charts or filters.
- **Testing**: Add unit and widget tests using `flutter_test` to ensure code reliability.
